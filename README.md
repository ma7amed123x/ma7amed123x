# Hi there, I'm Mohammed Tamer :wave:

*Backend Developer | Problem Solver | Competitive Programmer*

I'm a Computer Science and AI student at Benha University with a passion for building robust backend systems and solving complex algorithmic challenges. I love crafting clean, scalable APIs and diving deep into system architecture.

When I'm not coding backend services, you'll find me grinding competitive programming problems on Codeforces or exploring new technologies to add to my toolkit.
